/*
    BREAKPOINT - DEFINITION

    $breakpoints: list of lists 
                  one list-item with 3 parameters:

                  $name:    Name of the breakpoint
                  $start:   Start-Range. If Null, will trigger exclusion 
                            for first (mobile?) breakpoint.
                  $end:     value for the min-width part. If null, will
                            mark the breakpoint from $start with min-width.

    Examples:

    - Grid:
        The grid will be generated with the first $name (for ex. mobile) without a media
        query. So it also works as a "default" value. If there is no other breakpoint defined
        for a container like:
            <div class="mobile-100">, the container will always be 100% width.
        If you use:  <div class="mobile-100 desktop-50"> the container will have a width of
        100% inside mobile and tablet, but switches to 50% at desktop. 

    - Grid-Helpers:
        These are generated in a range for min-width to max-width.
        Best example here is mobile-hidden, tablet-hidden & desktop-hidden. These work just
        in their defined breakpoint range. So if you use mobile-hidden only, the container
        should only be set to display: none in the mobile breakpoint range.
